# Dashboard for openInApp

As a part of assignment i have created the UI for the Dashboard and have implemented following functionalities:
1. Greeting to the user based on the local Calender time.
2. Implemented line graph and analytics(Collection View) for all the points that are coming from api response.
3. Implemented different tabs controlling the listview for displaying top links and recent links.
4. Implemented copy link functionality.
5. Used scollView to implement the UI as the overall UI was very big to fit on the screen.

### Steps to Run the app:
1. Install cocoapods in your machine if not already installed.
2. Redirect to project folder and run `pod install`
3. Clean build and build the project in XCode.
4. I have put the dependency where the app will only run for `iOS version > 13.0`.
